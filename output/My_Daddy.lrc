My Daddy


Daddy's always there for me
Morning light and dark night
Guiding me through every storm
With his love so bright


Daddy's strong and full of might
He lifts me when I fall
In his arms I feel so safe
He's my hero tall


Oh my daddy you're my star
Shining near and far
With you here I'm never lost
You're my guiding heart


When I'm scared and all alone
Daddy makes it right
He can chase away the dark
With his warm delight


Daddy's love is all I need
Simple pure and true
Every smile and every laugh
Is because of you


Oh my daddy you're my star
Shining near and far
With you here I'm never lost
You're my guiding heart
