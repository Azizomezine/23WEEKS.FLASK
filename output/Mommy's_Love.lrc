Mommy's Love


Mommy's in the kitchen
Cooking something sweet
Smiles in the morning
Warm hugs so neat


She sings a little tune
As she sweeps the floor
Her words are like a blanket
They couldnâ€™t mean more


Mommy's love is magic
Her touch so pure and true
Every day gets better
With her by my side it's new


Stories by the bedside
Whispers in the dark
Her voice it soothes my soul
Lights up every spark


Mommy's always there
With a heart so wide
Holding my hand gently
Always on my side


Mommy's love is magic
Her touch so pure and true
Every day gets better
With her by my side it's new
