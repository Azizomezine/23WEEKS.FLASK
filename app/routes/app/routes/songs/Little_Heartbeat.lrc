Little Heartbeat


Little heartbeat inside me
Growing stronger day by day
I can’t wait to see your face
Hold you close and keep you safe


Tiny hands and tiny feet
Dreaming dreams oh so sweet
In my arms you’ll find your place
In my love a warm embrace


Oh little one my shining star
No matter where you are
I’ll always be your guiding light
Through every day and night


Kicks and flutters I can feel
This love for you so real
Your heartbeat’s song keeps me near
To you my baby dear


We’ll laugh we’ll play we’ll sing
You’re my everything
Can’t wait to meet you soon
Under the same bright moon


Oh little one my shining star
No matter where you are
I’ll always be your guiding light
Through every day and night
