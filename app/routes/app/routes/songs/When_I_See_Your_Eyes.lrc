When I See Your Eyes


When I see your eyes
World stops turning
Heart feels alive
Fire keeps burning


Every little word
Echoes in my heart
You and I together
Never be apart


Love is like a melody
Playing in my soul
You're my only harmony
Make me feel whole


Under moonlit sky
Holding you tight
Stars in the night
Shining so bright


When the rain falls
I'll be your shelter
Through it all
We'll
Face it together


Love is like a melody
Playing in my soul
You're my only harmony
Make me feel whole
