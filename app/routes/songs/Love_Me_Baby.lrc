Love Me Baby


Love me baby hold me tight
Stars are shining bright tonight
Feel this moment let it last
Forget the future and the past


Dancing close breathe you in
Heartbeats race under my skin
Through the night we fly so high
You and me touch the sky


Love me baby all night long
You and I where we belong
Shout it out feel the beat
In our hearts love is sweet


In your eyes I see the light
Stay with me till morning's bright
Hand in hand we'll find our way
Every night and every day


Love me baby all night long
You and I where we belong
Shout it out feel the beat
In our hearts love is sweet


Hold me close and never let go
Love's a river let it flow
Side by side we'll take the leap
Dream together in our sleep
